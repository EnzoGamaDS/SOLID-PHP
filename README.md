> ### Single responsibility principle (SPR)
- ###   <p>It's about reducing class coupling by splitting and giving each class just one function.</p>
- ###  <p>Each software module should have one and only one reason to change.<br> Uncle Bob </p> <br>
 
> ### Open/closed principle (OCP)
- ### <p>We must ensure that each action or responsibility is in the correct class through interfaces, access modifiers and getters/setters we can achieve this goal.</p>
- ### <p>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) must be open for extension but closed for modification.<br> Bertrand Meyer</p>
<br><br>

> ### Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
- ### <p>Attest to which method is being subtyped/ extended, so that there are no implementation conflicts.</p>
- ### <p>liskov's substitution principle, a base class must be able to be replaced by its child classes anywhere in the code</p>

> ### The interface segregation principle: I(SP)
- ### Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

> ### dependency inversion principle: 
- ### Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
